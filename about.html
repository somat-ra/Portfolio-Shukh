          The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood
          of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface and
          rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half
          of the twentieth century. As urban development changes that place, it
          will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs
          that are so special and unique. The letters that inspired this project
          have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and
          night! These are the types that make the city look so beautiful. The
          Montserrat Project began with the idea to rescue what is in Montserrat
          and set it free under a libre license, the SIL Open Font License. This
          is the normal family, and it has two sister families so far,
          Alternates and Subrayada. Many of the letterforms are special in the
          Alternates family, while 'Subrayada' means 'Underlined' in Spanish and
          celebrates a special style of underline that is integrated into the
          letterforms found in the Montserrat neighborhood.
